Continued working on project to make a program that can delete all files/registry keys involved with Smartview
Added funcionality for the removal of registry keys
Implemented DataGridView rather than TextBox to allow for check boxes to use as booleans, rather than needing to use a separate array, as well as the ability to denote if fire or registry key is being deleted
Researched registry to understand difference between registry keys and values
